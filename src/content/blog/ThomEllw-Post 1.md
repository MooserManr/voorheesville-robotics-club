# New Beginnings For VRC:

Club members began learning about Markdown Syntax and it's application for website devolpment during the HS meeting held on 10/20/25 in which members all created practice blogs and continued devloping their skills and comfort levels with the new Syntax and its applications. A wide variety of uses were expressed from embeded photos and links to different text structures and visual rendoring. Skills were continued to be refined on Thursday 10/23 when MS and HS members worked together to continue improving skills and getting the younger members up to par with the development of the clubs website. Members will continue to improve their skills in web development and will continue to improve and contribute to the website as needed.
