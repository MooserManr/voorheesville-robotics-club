## Introduction

After competing in multiple robotics competitions, we've learned some valuable lessons. Here are our top tips for competition success.

## 1. Test, Test, Test

Never assume your robot will work perfectly on competition day. Testing helps you:

- Find mechanical weaknesses
- Identify software bugs
- Practice driver skills
- Time your autonomous routines

**Pro tip**: Test in conditions similar to competition (lighting, floor surface, distractions).
